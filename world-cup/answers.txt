Times:

10 simulations: 0m0.025s
100 simulations: 0m0.026s
1000 simulations: 0m0.029s
10000 simulations: 0m0.068s
100000 simulations: 0m0.404s
1000000 simulations: 0m3.574s

Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The simulation for 0m0.068s seems to be the winner.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems like the predictions stabilized after about the 10000 count.
